    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Web development is an exciting journey that opens up countless opportunities in today's digital world. 
        Whether you're looking to build your own website, start a career in tech, or bring your ideas to life, 
        learning web development is the first step.
    </p>

    <h2>What is Web Development?</h2>
    <p>
        Web development refers to the creating, building, and maintaining of websites. It includes aspects such as 
        web design, web publishing, web programming, and database management. The field encompasses everything from 
        creating simple text pages to complex web applications.
    </p>

    <h3>The Three Pillars of Web Development</h3>
    <p>Modern web development is built on three core technologies:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>HTML (HyperText Markup Language)</strong> - The structure and content of web pages</li>
        <li><strong>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</strong> - The styling and visual presentation</li>
        <li><strong>JavaScript</strong> - The interactive functionality and behavior</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
    <p>
        To begin your web development journey, you'll need just a few basic tools:
    </p>
    
    <ol>
        <li>A text editor (like VS Code, Sublime Text, or Atom)</li>
        <li>A web browser (Chrome, Firefox, or Safari)</li>
        <li>Enthusiasm and curiosity to learn!</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Your First HTML Page</h3>
    <p>
        Creating your first web page is simpler than you might think. Here's a basic example:
    </p>
    
    <pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;My First Page&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Hello World!&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Welcome to my website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>

    <h2>Learning Path</h2>
    <p>
        We recommend following this structured approach to learning web development:
